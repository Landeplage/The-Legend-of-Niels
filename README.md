# The-Legend-of-Niels
Example project for a sound design workshop held for students at Namdal FHS.

## How the audio implementation works
- The audio implementation uses "AudioEvents", made using Scriptable Objects. These are stored under Assets > Resources > AudioEvents.
- Create new ones by going to Assets > Create > AudioEvents > AudioEvent, or by duplicating the existing ones.
- The system is a work in progress, so probably buggy.
- Audio clips are stored under Assets > Resources > AudioClips.
